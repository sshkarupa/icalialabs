  bio: "Cejas is a simple being with a simple life in a complex universe. He majored in physics but he happens to love coding. He is the kind of human being who collects more questions than answers. He spends his days coding, drawing, designing, writing or just meditating. Indeed he is always busy but open to have a glass with red wine and discuss philosophical subjects just for fun."
