			<p>
				Create a web app that helps millenials reach their financial goals. As a demographic that is known to live in the moment, how do you help them save enough for their short and medium term goals?
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, Banregio wanted a product that broke out of the bureaucratic process sometimes associated with Banks in Mexico. They needed a delightful product which helps their your customers accomplish their goals, without getting in the way.

				After a lengthy discussion with the client, in order to fully understand our client's wants and needs. We began by reflecting and exploring similar services and solutions. In parallel, we started working to define the app architecture.

					The bank wanted to create something different, yet not too distant from the seriouness of the Bank's image. They were looking for something that could attract millenials without scaring them with very formal product.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given that our client had already chosen the product's name "Cochi", as in a piggy bank, we worked to create something that would be reminiscent of our earliest memories with saving. Perhaps reminding our end-consumer about the very first time they saved up their allowances.

				In order to make things as simple and straight forward as possible for the user, we focused on building a product that could just get the work previously needed for saving out of the way.

				By working and testing several prototypes, we came up with a solution that guides the user through a simple on-boarding process and then everything just gets out the way and just focuses the user to start saving. Later enabling them to keep tabs on their savings with a simple yet powerful dashboard.
