		<div class="pull-right big-block">
			<p>
				We notice that most people needed some kind of input, to make the task of picking a doctor a lot easier. Thats is why we created “Okudoc”. Okudoc lets people choose from top doctors from around them, and filter the results easily, to find the perfect fit for them. With Okudoc not only will the price be the only way to find your doctor, if they have assurance affiliation, how close they are to your location, or as simple as their gender to make you feel more comfortable at the moment of your checkup.

			<h5 class="case-study-title">Branding</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="pull-right big-block">
			<p>
				In the process of creating the correct branding for this product, we had to deeply think who is the one that cares the most for the health in general aspects. After a lot of research, we came to find that it was the woman in the family who cares most about everyone's health. We created a female oriented app, but we took into mind that not only women would be the ones using it. We ended up with a very colorful but simple design.
			</p>
			<p>
				The colors are the direct reflection of what we wanted to transmit. With the purple color we were looking to engage the trust of women on their quest of searching for a doctor online.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, the OkuDoc logo represents the union and strength of the involved parts. We represent that with the 3 circles users, OkuDoc and finally the doctors. As well as representing the social part the client was aiming at making it look like the share symbol. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We created a new typography in order to have that distinctive touch when being compared with other solutions. On which the distinctive part is the cuts over the 2 parts of the name Oku Doc.

			After you had the appointment with you doctor, the patient gives a comment about the doctor so that more references can be added to his profile.

				We used as main element the emptiness and the white spaces to give it a serious and professional touch. We design a clean and modern application that is accompanied by subtle colors that play a reinforcement role in gaining the user trust.
