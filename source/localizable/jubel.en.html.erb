		<h6 class="case-study__title">THE CHALLENGE</h6>
		<h2 class="case-study__question">¿How to automate already proven processes to <span>unlock growth</span>?</h2>
		<p class="case-study__content">
			Jubel had already been operating for quite some time and had been well accepted by the community.  They wanted to figure out what was stopping them from growing, and how could they automate some of their already proven processes.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="smaller-container">
		<h6 class="case-study__title">OUR APPROACH</h6>
		<p class="case-study__regular">
			We studied how Jubel operated and their analogue process of curating travel experiences for their customers, and turned that into digital, reusable patterns; enabling a way to match the traveler’s preferences to travel plans and destinations directly on the platform.
		</p>
		<p class="case-study__regular">
			Providing this would imply for Jubel representatives a way to speed up how they provide custom made trips to their clients; <span>while greatly increasing the number of clients they can attend to.</span>
